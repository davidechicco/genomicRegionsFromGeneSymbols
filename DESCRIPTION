Description: A package whose main function reads a list of gene symbols, connects to GEO, retrieves the genomic coordinates of those gene symbols in the GRCh38/hg38 reference assembly, and saves them into a CSV or BED file. For example, to the gene symbol IGFBP2 it retrieves the chr2:216632828-216664436 genomic region. The mapping is done through the GPL96 Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform. Please notice that some gene symbols might not be mapped.
